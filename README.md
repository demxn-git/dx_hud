# dx_hud

This started as a fork of Cosmo HUD but ended up being a complete rewrite.  
dx_hud is an HUD for FiveM and ESX Legacy.

## Requirements

- es_extended (Legacy)
- esx_status
- esx_basicneeds

## Voice services configuration

You can change the voice service the HUD will be using in the config file.  
Currently supported options are:
- pma-voice
- saltychat

## Download & Installation


### Using Git

```
cd resources
git clone https://github.com/0xDEMXN/dx_hud.git
```

### Manually

- Go to the [releases page](https://github.com/0xDEMXN/dx_hud/releases "Releases page") and download the latest release
- Place it inside the `resources` directory

### Installation

- Edit `config.lua` to fit your needs
- Add the resource to your `server.cfg` after dependencies to make sure it's started correctly at server startup:

```
ensure dx_hud
```
